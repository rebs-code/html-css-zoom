# Zoom View with Chat Open
This project aims to replicate the Zoom user interface with an open chat window. It includes a header, main video container, and a footer with buttons for mute, video stop, and various other meeting controls.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

### HTML Structure
Header: Contains buttons for switching to speaker view and maximizing the window.

Main Section: Displays a grid of video boxes, each containing a user's video thumbnail and their name. The user's microphone status is indicated with an icon.

Footer: Comprises three sections:
Left Buttons: Buttons for muting/unmuting and stopping/starting video.
Center Bar: Icons and labels for various meeting controls, such as inviting participants, managing participants, polling, sharing screen, and more. The chat icon includes a chevron indicating an open chat window.
Right Button: A button to end the meeting.

### External Dependencies
